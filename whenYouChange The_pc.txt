add the tomcat then 

create your  DB  again with derby 
then 

add the javaDb Driver deja include  derby driver 
----------------------------
I think the problem you have is that you don't have the Derby driver in the classpath of the project.

You can easily achieve that adding the JavaDB library to your project:

    Right-click on the project
    Properties -> Libraries
    Add Library -> JavaDB driver

This includes derby.jar, derbyclient.jar and derbynet.jar in your project's classpath.

The derbyclient.jar contains the class org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver your code is complaining about.

then it will wotk normal
